# Patient Demographic Analysis

## Description
Brief description of your healthcare analytics project.

## SQL Analysis

### Patient Encounter Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze patient demographics and hospital encounter patterns to understand length of stay and patient characteristics.

**Key Query Features:**
- Patient demographics (age, gender, race, location)
- Encounter types and duration
- Length of Stay (LOS) calculations
- Temporal analysis by admission year

```sql
SELECT
    p.Id,
    p.GENDER,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, p.BIRTHDATE, GETDATE()) AS age,
    p.CITY,
    p.RACE,
    e.ENCOUNTERCLASS,
    e.[START] AS admission,
    e.STOP AS discharge,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, e.[START], e.STOP) AS LOS,
    YEAR(e.START) AS admission_year
FROM  
    patients p  
JOIN encounters e ON p.Id = e.PATIENT
WHERE 
    e.STOP IS NOT NULL 
    AND e.[START] IS NOT NULL
    AND DATEDIFF(DAY, e.[START], e.STOP) > 0;
```

## Power BI Dashboard & Data Modeling

### Power Query Transformations

**Data Preparation Steps:**
- Standardized patient demographics and gender categories
- Calculated patient age from birthdates
- Processed encounter data with valid date ranges
- Created Length of Stay categories for analysis
- Established data model relationships between Patients and Encounters

### DAX Calculations

**Age Group Categorization:**
```markdown
```dax
Age Group = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Patient[Age] < 18, "0-17",
    Patient[Age] <= 35, "18-35", 
    Patient[Age] < 65, "36-64",
    "65+"
)
```

### Interactive Dashboard

**Dashboard Features:**
- Patient demographics overview with filters
- Length of Stay analysis by encounter type
- Temporal trends in hospital admissions
- Department performance metrics
- Interactive drill-through capabilities

**Key Insights Visualized:**
- üìä **35%** of encounters are outpatient services
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Average LOS** of 3.2 days across all encounter types
- üìà **15% increase** in emergency visits during winter months
- üë• **Gender distribution** remains consistent across all metrics
